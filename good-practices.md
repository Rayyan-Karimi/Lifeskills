Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

- Preserving attention: I need to use less social media, because sometimes I exhaust my brain capacity with it.
- Tracking of time: Sometimes its hard to meet deadlines because of attention problems on main task. I will focus better, now that I can avoid distractions.

- Documentation: I will make sure to document everything, so that I can refer to it later.
