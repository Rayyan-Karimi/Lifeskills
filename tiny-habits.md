## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
- You need to consider behaviour for a certain outcome.
- Implementation intentions can help us build new habits, ie - habits are more likely to stick when they are tied to positive emotions, which is why celebrating even tiny wins is crucial.

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

- M = Motivation
- A = Action
- P = Prompt
- Behaviour is associated with the MAP as motivation to do something, action to perform, and prompt to remind you to do it.

### Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

- Celebrating creates a positive emotion with the habit. 
- This reinforces the behavior and makes it more likely to become automatic over time. 
- Whatever you celebrate, strengthens the neural pathways associated with that habit.

## 3. 1% Better Every Day Video

### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

- The idea that small, consistent improvements compound over time was excellent. 
- For example, improving by just 1% every day may seem insignificant, but over a year, this leads to massive growth due to the compounding effect. 
- Conversely, neglecting small habits can lead to a decline over time. 
- This reinforces the importance of focusing on small, consistent actions.

## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits

### What is the book's perspective about Identity?

- The book suggests that lasting habit change starts with identity transformation.
- Instead of focusing solely on outcomes (e.g., “I want to run a marathon”), align with the identity of someone who achieves the goal (e.g., “I am a runner”).
- This shift in self-perception creates stronger motivation for consistency.


### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

- Apply the two-minute rule: Start with a small, manageable version of the habit, like writing one line instead of an entire journal entry.
- Optimize your environment: Set up your surroundings to make the desired habit effortless, such as placing your workout clothes where you’ll see them in the morning.


### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

- Add friction: Introduce hurdles that make undesirable habits harder, such as logging out of social media accounts after each use.
- Remove triggers: Eliminate environmental cues that prompt the habit, like keeping junk food out of the house.
- Create accountability: Make undesirable habits costly by involving someone to monitor your progress or imposing penalties for slipping up.

## 5. Reflection:

### Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

**Habit**: Journaling daily.
Action Plan:

- Cue visibility: Place your journal and pen in a noticeable spot.
- Increase appeal: Pair journaling with a reward, like enjoying a morning coffee.
- Ease of action: Begin with a small goal, like only writing one sentence.
- Satisfying outcome: When you do it, you will feel successful in developing a new habit. Then you can even reward yourself with something, like a cold shower afterwards.

### Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

**Habit**: Excessive use of social media.
Action Plan:

- Reduce cues: I turn off notifications and uninstalled some social media apps.
- Diminish appeal: Reminded myself of the wasted time.
- Add difficulty: I generally can log out after each use to create an extra effort for access.
- Unsatisfying result: When I track the time spent on social media and see how it could have been better utilized, I realise it didnt really make me happy, for the long run.
