## Learning how to learn

### Q2 : In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
- Pomodoro technique
- Slow learning can achieve us solid mastery of principles.
- Spin the wheel - practice. Redo.

### Q3 : What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
- Both these modes are actually part of a learning process of someone to gain knowledge about something.
- Active learning is when the focus is there - practicing may be involved - fast targets may be accomplished - chapters/main points may be identified and stored for importance.
- Diffused learning is when the learner is actually not in focus on the in-hand task, but rather casually strafing over it. In such a mode, the mind of the learner is more creative than focused mode.

## 5. Learning Principles in the Bootcamp

### Q5 : What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

- I have started explaining CSS to my room-mates. #Feynman-Techinque
- I will practice what I learn - and redo multiple times in a month.
